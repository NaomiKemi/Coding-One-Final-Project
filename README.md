# Coding-One-Final-Project

Within this unit we have used practical programming to create pieces of work from sound, images, and 3D graphics. These projects heavily used C++, JavaScript including other creative frameworks to complete weekly homeworkâ€™s. Lecturers introduced me to many artists, but my inspiration drew from artist like Katharina Brunner and Manolo Gamboa Naon as their work was closely connected to the weekly homework we completed. Manolo uses algorithmic tools to create his pieces. Drawing influence from the are artist suggested by our lecturers to the ones that I found myself I was able to use these techniques to generate original creative works. 

Further into the unit we explored images processing. When looking into creating 2D graphics I further developed Flores geometrici using the mouse to control the formation of the petals, I also affected the speed and the direction of which the flowers were going and growing. Using the rose curve algorithm allowed me to understand the basics. I also used K as the number of petals, but I formed it in an irreducible fraction which I learnt how to do using a section from a Wikipedia page based on rose mathematics. I really love creating this project because showed me how to use polar coordinates to create a beautiful flower. After a few weeks in the unit, I learnt how to use if statements which I used in this so the direction of two of the flowers could be constantly moving.
